# Lab3-Huffman-Tree
This algorithm will build a Huffman tree using a dictionary of stored symbols and their corresponding frequencies. Once the tree is built it will be traversed in pre-order. The binary represenation of the symbols and pre-order traversal results will be written to the outputfile, 'HuffmanOutputs.txt'. The script also contains functions to decode binary strings and encode strings containing symbols. The 'HuffmanInputs.txt' file contains 10 strings to encode and 10 strings to decode. The binary representation of each symbol is based on the given frequency,so in order to change the binary representation of a symbol, the frequency of the symbols within the Freq_table dictionary will need to be changed. To execute the script, make sure the input and output files are within the same directory.
